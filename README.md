# Implementation-of-Affine-Cipher

The affine cipher is a combination of additive cipher and multiplicative cipher.

    C = [(P * a) + b] mod n        # C = Chiper text , P = Plain text, n = 26 (length of alphabets)
    P = [(C â€“ b) * a^(-1) ] mod n     # (a,b) two keys are used for Affine Cipher.
